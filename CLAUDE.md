# CLAUDE.md — paad

## What this project is

This is a **Claude Code plugin marketplace** hosted at `github.com/Ovid/paad`. It distributes the `paad` plugin, which provides skills for architecture analysis, code quality, and development workflows.

## Key conventions

- **Marketplace name**: `paad`
- **Plugin name**: `paad` (so all skills are invoked as `/paad:<skill-name>`)
- **Skill naming**: skill folder names become the suffix after `paad:` — e.g., `skills/agentic-architecture/` → `/paad:agentic-architecture`
- **Versioning**: both `marketplace.json` and `plugin.json` use semver. Bump the plugin version in `plugin.json` (it takes precedence). Keep `marketplace.json` version in sync.
- **Validation**: run `claude plugin validate .` (marketplace) and `claude plugin validate ./plugins/paad` (plugin) before committing

## Adding a new skill

1. Create `plugins/paad/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` with frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and instructions
2. Consider `$ARGUMENTS` support — if the skill could benefit from user-provided scope (a file path, directory, branch name, etc.), add an Arguments section documenting usage. Users shouldn't need to remember flags; keep arguments positional and intuitive (e.g., `/paad:skillname path/to/scope`).
3. Add a graphviz digraph (```dot block) covering the skill's decision points and flow. The only exception is `paad:help`, which is a simple display skill. See "Digraph requirements" below.
4. Validate with `claude plugin validate ./plugins/paad`
5. Test locally with `claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/paad`
6. Bump the version in both `plugins/paad/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
7. Update `README.md` to document the new skill under "Available Skills", including argument syntax in the heading
8. Add the new skill to `paad:help` — both the overview table and a detailed help section

## Modifying an existing skill

When changing a skill's behavior, arguments, or output, review `plugins/paad/skills/help/SKILL.md` and update the corresponding help text to match.

## Digraph requirements

Every skill (except `paad:help`) must include at least one graphviz digraph (`\`\`\`dot` block) that visualizes the skill's decision points and flow. Digraphs must be:

- **Complete** — every decision point, stop condition, and branching path in the prose must appear in the digraph
- **Accurate** — node labels, edge labels, and flow must match the prose exactly. If the prose changes, the digraph must be updated to match.
- **Relevant** — digraphs exist to prevent the agent from skipping safety gates or misordering steps. Focus on decision points where the agent could cause damage by skipping ahead, not on linear sequences that are obvious from the prose.

When modifying a skill's flow, check that the digraph still matches. When reviewing a skill, cross-reference the digraph against the prose.

## Important rules

- Do NOT put `skills/`, `commands/`, or `agents/` inside `.claude-plugin/` — only `plugin.json` or `marketplace.json` go there
- Skill files must be named `SKILL.md` (uppercase) inside a folder whose name becomes the skill name
- Plugin sources in `marketplace.json` use paths relative to the marketplace root (start with `./`)
- Keep marketplace.json plugin descriptions in sync with plugin.json descriptions
